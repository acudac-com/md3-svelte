# Overview

This [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/docs) library implements the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) open-source design system. It uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as far as possible to allow customizing provided components. The latter is possible thanks to [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge).
